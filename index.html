                       <p><b><u>Basic Idea:</u></b>
                            Energy efficiency and security are of highest concern in recent
                            times. We propose &#39;Home Security&#39; system and smart
                            lighting as an important feature of modern sophisticated residential
                            and office leaving. These must be affordable, reliable and effective.
                            Home security system involves features like fire, smoke, electric
                            door lock, intruders, etc. Smart lighting help in energy conservation
                            and thus prevents consumption of lighting energy during
                            unnecessary hours of the day. We implement PIR sensor to detect
                            motion and GSM module for sending message to the police as well
                            as to the related owner of the building in case of intruder alert.

                            <b><u>Social Relevance:</u></b>
                            Security is one of the main concern of the recent times. In present
                            world of technological advancement proper care should be taken to
                            maintain security and comfort of homes, offices, banks, etc. In this
                            project we have designed a simple but very efficient home security
                            and lighting system. This device has a function of messaging the
                            owner on his/her mobile number in case of an intruder alert and
                            
                            saving energy from unnecessary lighting. The project takes into
                            consideration the existing products and merge them together to
                            create a smart house which not only conserves energy but also take
                            into consideration the security features.

                            <b><u>Objective:</u></b>
                            The main aim of this project is to inform the owner about an
                            intruder alert, so that he/she can take necessary steps.
                            To decrease the energy consumption i.e. efficient use of the
                            energy</p>
